## Astrophysical parameter estimation based on non-Gaussian Features in Intensity Maps
The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array ([HERA](https://reionization.org/)) is a radio interferometer designed to detect the 21 cm signal from hydrogen originating from the early universe, especially during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn. Intensity mapping provides a unique lens for exploring non-Gaussian characteristics in cosmological signals, extanding beyond the random Gaussian fields, which is crucial for studying the properties of early galaxies. In this study, I used a Fisher information matrix to predict the detectability of the second and third moments for future HERA observations. The third moment, or skewness, serves as a tool for measuring non-Gaussinity in the 21 cm signals. The forecast suggests that with sufficiently long observation times and effective foreground removal, combining the second and third moments yields tight confidence intervals for model estimation.
