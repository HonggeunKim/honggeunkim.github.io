## Effects of Systematics on non-Gaussian Features in Intensity Maps
Intensity mapping provides a unique lens for exploring non-Gaussian characteristics in cosmological signals, beyond the random Gaussian fields, which is important to investigate the properties of early galaxies. However, if the observational data is contaminated by some intrumental systematics,
