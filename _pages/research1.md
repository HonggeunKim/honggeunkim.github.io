## Effects of Systematics on non-Gaussian Features in Intensity Maps
The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array ([HERA](https://reionization.org/)) is a radio interferometer designed to detect the 21 cm signal from hydrogen originating from the early universe, especially during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn. Intensity mapping provides a unique lens for exploring non-Gaussian characteristics in cosmological signals, beyond the random Gaussian fields, which is important to investigate the properties of early galaxies. However, if the observational data is contaminated by some intrumental systematics, the systematics can induce non-Gaussianity, making it challenge to interpret the observational data appropriately. In this study, using the HERA observational data, I explored the effects of systematics on one-point statistics and
