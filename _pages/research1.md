## Effects of Systematics on non-Gaussian Features in Intensity Maps
The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array ([HERA](https://reionization.org/)) is a radio interferometer designed to detect the 21 cm signal from hydrogen originating from the early universe, especially during the Epoch of Reionization and Cosmic Dawn. Intensity mapping provides a unique lens for exploring non-Gaussian characteristics in cosmological signals, extanding beyond the random Gaussian fields, which is crucial for studying the properties of early galaxies. However, if the observational data is contaminated by some intrumental systematicsthese can introduce non-Gaussianity, complicating the interpretation of the data. In this study, I analyzed the impact of systematics on one-point statistics using HERA observational data and applied frequentist statistics based on the likelihood of the observed data to assess specific cosmological models.
