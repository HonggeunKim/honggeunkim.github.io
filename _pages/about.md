I am a physics graduate student at MIT in the [Kavli Institute for Astrophysics](https://space.mit.edu/), expected to graduate in the summer of 2024, with a deep passion for exploring the high-redshift universe and cosmology. My research interests are centered at radio astronomical observations and their statistical interpretation, where I aim to uncover the mysteries of the early universe through cutting-edge data analysis and innovative methodologies.

My major work involves the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array ([HEAR](https://reionization.org/)), a radio interferometric telescope. This work encompasses comprehensive statisitical inference on large datasets, including one-point statistics and power spectrum analysis, for 21 cm cosmology and line intensity mapping experiments. Recently, I have focused on extracting essential geometrical and tomographic information from 2D radio images using a U-net architecture.
