## Imaging Data cubes using HERA observations
Image cubes are crucial in radio astronomy because they allow astronomers to study the spatial and spectral (frequency) properties of astronomical sources simultaneously. An image cube, also known as a data cube, is a three-dimensional dataset where two dimensions represent spatial coordinates (such as right ascension and declination), and the third dimension represents frequency. In this study, I constructed image cubes from HERA Phase I observations and analyzed how systematics impact one-point statistics measurements.
