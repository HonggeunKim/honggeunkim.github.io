description: My research interests focus on developing tools to evaluate various statistical properties of the early universe as observed through radio telescopes. Broadly, I am interested in the formation and evolution of the universe star and galaxy formation, large scale structure, and cosmological data analysis. I am particularly enthusiastic about using machine learning methods to extract cosmological information from intensity mapping experiments, offering a unique perspective for theoretical analysis of observational data. I am also keen on developing computationally efficient codes that enable the simulation of large data volumes within a reasonable timeframe.
